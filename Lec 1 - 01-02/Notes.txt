# HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
# HyperText: A system allowing documents to be linked together, enabling users to navigate between them.
# Markup: The use of tags or symbols to annotate text, indicating how it should be structured or formatted.
Eg - like in past author used to add a squiggle line to tell publisher to bold it just like that it is used to tell about the structure of the document
# Language: A set of rules and conventions for communication, in this context, specifying the structure and presentation of web documents.
